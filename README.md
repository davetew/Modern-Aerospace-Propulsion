Analyses and Data for the Modern Aerospace Propulsion course @ Columbia

## Installation

This repository is structured as a Python package. You can install it in several ways:

### Install from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/davetew/Modern-Aerospace-Propulsion.git
cd Modern-Aerospace-Propulsion

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode (editable)
pip install -e .
```

### Install Development Dependencies
For development work (testing, linting, etc.):
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# Or install with optional dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Using the Package
Once installed, you can import the compressible flow utilities in your Python code:
```python
from modern_aerospace_propulsion import compressible_flow

# Use temperature conversions
T_celsius = compressible_flow.K2C(300)  # Convert 300 K to Celsius

# Use compressible flow relations
theta = compressible_flow.Î¸(2.0)  # Temperature ratio at Mach 2.0
```
