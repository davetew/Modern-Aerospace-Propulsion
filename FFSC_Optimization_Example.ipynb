    "### Common Issues and Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. \"Maximum iterations reached\"**\n",
    "- **Solution**: Increase `max_iterations` to 200-300\n",
    "- **Why**: Complex design space needs more exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. \"Positive directional derivative for linesearch\"**\n",
    "- **Solution**: Try `trust-constr` optimizer instead of SLSQP\n",
    "- **Why**: SLSQP can struggle with constraint boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Optimizer stops early with poor Isp**\n",
    "- **Solution**: Provide better `initial_guess` closer to expected result\n",
    "- **Why**: May be stuck in local minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Infeasible constraints**\n",
    "- **Solution**: Temporarily relax `T_wall_max_limit` (e.g., 950 K) or widen bounds\n",
    "- **Why**: Design space may be too constrained\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Oscillating between designs**\n",
    "- **Solution**: Use staged optimization (wide → tight bounds)\n",
    "- **Why**: Fine-tunes solution after finding approximate region\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Settings by Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy problems** (loose constraints, wide feasible region):\n",
    "- SLSQP, 100 iterations, default bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medium problems** (some tight constraints):\n",
    "- SLSQP, 150-200 iterations, better initial guess\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficult problems** (tight constraints, narrow feasible region):\n",
    "- trust-constr, 200 iterations, staged optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Very difficult problems** (highly constrained):\n",
    "- Staged optimization with relaxed then tight constraints\n",
    "- Multiple random initial guesses to find global optimum"
